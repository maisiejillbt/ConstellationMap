## - Zodiac Map is a spacially accurate 3D rendering of 12 of the most famous zodiac constellations in our visible universe.

With Zodiac Map you can easily toggle between zodiac signs to view the constellations as if you're right there with them in space.

Zodiac Map uses ThreeJs in order to map the stars and make them appear on your screen in 3D. It also uses data from [AstroNexus](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) in order to map the stars as they would be found in space.
