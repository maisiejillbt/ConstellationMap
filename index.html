    <h1>Woah, far out</h1>
    <p>
      You're probably way out here trying to track down one of the two stars that look
      like they keep going forever. I have some disappointing news for you, the one in 
      the Sagittarii Constellation <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_Sagittarii">Mu Sagittarii</a> (Polis) 
      is 36,240 light years away. For reference the star in the Leo constellation thats 
      also really far out <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Leonis">Eta Leonis</a> is 1270 light years away. 
      To be totally honest, I was surprised it rendered at all, that being said 
      you can't reach it in this app. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Anyway, the other one <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta1_Scorpii">Zeta 1 Scorpii</a> is my personal Moby-Dick, 
      I never read the book, but from what I gathered the whale is incredibly illusive.
      So is this star, I welcome you to try and get close to it, but after having personally 
      spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to get close to it I've still only ever come 
      up empty handed. 
      <br>
      <br>
      You've also probably noticed my cube of stars, fun fact, those stars aren't real. 
      Meaning they were randomly generated by me, and unlike the constellation stars, 
      their positions aren't rooted in any kind of factual data. I added them because as 
      it turns out, space is mostly.. space, and without them the page just looked really 
      empty.
      <br>
      <br>
      Regardless of why you're here, I hope you're enjoying the site, don't stay on too 
      long though, you will get dizzy!
      <br>
      <br>
